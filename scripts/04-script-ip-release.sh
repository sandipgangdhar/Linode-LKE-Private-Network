# 04-script-ip-release.sh
# 
# This shell script handles IP address release by interacting with the VLAN
# Leader Manager's REST API. It releases an assigned IP back to the pool and
# logs the result.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------
# üìù Parameters:
# 
# 1Ô∏è‚É£ IP_ADDRESS          - The IP address to be released back to the pool.
# 2Ô∏è‚É£ API_ENDPOINT        - The endpoint for IP release requests.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------
# üîÑ Usage:
# 
# - This script is executed when an IP address is no longer required.
# - It calls the API to release the IP address from the allocation pool.
# - If successful, the IP is removed from active usage.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------
# üìå Best Practices:
# 
# - Ensure the API is reachable before executing the script.
# - Monitor logs for successful IP release or errors.
# - Handle API timeouts and unexpected responses gracefully.
