# 03-script-ip-allocate.sh
# 
# This shell script handles IP address allocation by interacting with the VLAN
# Leader Manager's REST API. It requests an available IP from the specified subnet
# and logs the result.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------
# üìù Parameters:
# 
# 1Ô∏è‚É£ SUBNET              - The subnet from which IPs are allocated.
# 2Ô∏è‚É£ API_ENDPOINT        - The endpoint for IP allocation requests.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------
# üîÑ Usage:
# 
# - This script is executed during VLAN manager initialization or scale-up events.
# - It calls the API to request an available IP address.
# - If successful, the IP is logged and returned.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------
# üìå Best Practices:
# 
# - Ensure the API is reachable before executing the script.
# - Monitor logs for successful IP allocation or errors.
# - Handle API timeouts and unexpected responses gracefully.
