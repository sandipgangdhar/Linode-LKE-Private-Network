# This YAML file defines a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for Linode Block Storage.       
# It is used to request persistent storage of 1Gi with ReadWriteOnce access.           
# The PVC is bound to the 'linode-block-storage' StorageClass.                         
#

# - This PVC is used to mount a Linode Block Storage volume to a Pod.                  
# - Any Pod that uses this claim will have access to the 1Gi of persistent storage.    
#

# - For multi-node read/write access, consider using 'ReadWriteMany'.                  
# - Regularly monitor usage to prevent overflow on the 1Gi allocation.
