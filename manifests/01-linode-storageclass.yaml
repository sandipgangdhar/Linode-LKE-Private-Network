# 01-linode-storageclass.yaml
# 
# This YAML file defines a Kubernetes StorageClass for Linode Block Storage.
# It specifies how dynamic provisioning of PersistentVolumes (PVs) should occur
# for applications requiring persistent storage in the Linode infrastructure.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------
# üìù Parameters:
# 
# 1Ô∏è‚É£ name                  - The name of the StorageClass.
# 2Ô∏è‚É£ provisioner           - The CSI driver for Linode Block Storage.
# 3Ô∏è‚É£ reclaimPolicy         - Determines what happens to the volume after its release.
#                            - 'Retain' means the volume is not deleted after release.
# 4Ô∏è‚É£ volumeBindingMode     - Controls when the PersistentVolume is provisioned.
#                            - 'Immediate' means it is created as soon as it is requested.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------
# üîÑ Usage:
# 
# - This StorageClass is used by PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) to dynamically
#   create block storage volumes in Linode.
# - Any PVC that specifies 'linode-block-storage' as its storage class will
#   provision a new Linode Block Storage volume automatically.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------
# üìå Best Practices:
# 
# - For production, consider using 'Delete' as reclaimPolicy to prevent
#   orphaned volumes if you don't need data persistence.
# - For mission-critical data, snapshot backups are recommended.
